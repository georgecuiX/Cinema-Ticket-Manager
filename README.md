# Cinema Ticket Manager

## Description
This application is designed as a simple and interactive way to simulate ticket sales for a movie theatre. The program tracks the sales of tickets, updates the seating layout, and calculates the total revenue generated.
This application was made while I was enrolled in an introductory Computer Science course named CPS109 (Computer Science I), where we were instructed to make a simple Python application that did whatever you wanted. 
It involves basic concepts in Python programming such as loops, conditional statements, input/output operations, and global variable management.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Download the a1.py file to your local machine.
3. Open your command line interface (CLI).
